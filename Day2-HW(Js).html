<!-- You are building a simple contact manager app. Each contact has a name, phone number,and email address.
You want to group contacts as objects and add a method that shows the contact's full information in a neat format.

Your tasks are:
Create an object called contact1 with the following properties: name, phone, and email.
Add a method getInfo inside the object that returns a single string combining all the contact details.
Create a function printContactInfo(contact) that takes a contact object as a parameter and prints its getInfo() result.
Create another contact called contact2 using the same structure.
Call the printContactInfo() function for both contacts. -->
