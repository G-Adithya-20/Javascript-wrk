 <!-- You have some information from a user in JSON format,
including their name, email, and message. Your job is to:
Convert this JSON text into a JavaScript object.
Write a named arrow function that tries to print "Message received 
from <name>".
If something goes wrong (like the JSON is broken), show an error message.
Run the function to show the result in the console. -->
